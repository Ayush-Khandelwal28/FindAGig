# FindAGig

Welcome to FindAGig, the platform where freelancers and project owners meet! FindAGig is designed to streamline the process of finding gigs for freelancers and matching them with project owners looking for their skills.

## Features

### 1. Bidding with Zero Knowledge Proof

One of our core functionalities is bidding with Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Project owners can post their projects along with the necessary details, and freelancers can bid on them securely using ZKP. This ensures that the bidding process is secure and transparent. Once the bidding period ends, FindAGig will display the winning bid along with the user who made it.

### 2. Escrow Contract

To provide additional security for both project owners and freelancers, FindAGig facilitates the creation of escrow contracts. When a project is awarded to a freelancer, both parties stake a predetermined amount and sign a contract. The freelancer then submits their work through FindAGig, which the project owner can review and approve. This ensures that both parties fulfill their obligations before any payment is made.

### 3. Dispute Resolution

In the event of a dispute regarding the payment amount between the project owner and freelancer, FindAGig offers a robust dispute resolution mechanism. A panel of arbiters votes on the dispute using Zero Knowledge Proof. The number of "yes" and "no" votes determines the final payment amount to be made to the freelancer, ensuring fair and impartial resolution.
